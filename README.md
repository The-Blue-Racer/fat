# Fat Version

By Damir Olejar

----------
This is a fat version of all the components put together to create a working backend mirco-framework for Java.
The reason why I am doing this is to share the knowledge I have accummulated over a decade working as a developer. I would like to address some of the most common issues with the Java micro-frameworks, and offer a solution combining several technologies into a functioning whole, without reinventing the wheel.

Without naming and pointing the finger at the certain most common technologies that multi-million dollar companies are using, when it comes to work and developer satisfaction and a productivity, many companies fail at this level. For example, testing and deploying should not take 5-30min for just one change to test (full-stack). It is a drain on resources.

Another big problem is having too many components depending on each-other, which causes the great imbalance and things often failing to deliver the expectations. 

There are many other issues that will be addressed in the future, and in my opinion, all of them have the same and common causes. Technology and solutions are supposed to make things easier, and this is where most of the solutions have failed.
